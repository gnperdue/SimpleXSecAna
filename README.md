This is a very simple [ROOT](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/) analysis program to 
do cross section analysis on a [GENIE](http://genie.hepforge.org) file 
containing `GHepRecord`s.

It also contains some simple classes to demo analysis on a `gst` file 
and on a `gRooTracker` file.

It currently works on _LINUX only_.
